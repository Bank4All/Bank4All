# List of problems for Banking Industry
## Horizon + Vertical Key management
### How to store large data set with volatile or persisted existence
#### Referential Cross Problem

> ## Referential Central Key
>
> Decentralized or not, all bank services will need at one point to receive notification
> of key modification
>> ### SELECT last version
>>> - Scheduled Batches
>>> - Scheduled Reports
>> ### ON INSERT BEFORE
>>> - Desactivate Caches
>>> - Alert impact Tracer
>> ### ON INSERT AFTER
>>> - Recompute real time system
>>> - Recompute Keys dependancies

> ## Data Quality manangement
>
> Data has multipurpose and as countrary as Google, need to be handle strictly,
> requiring different strategy of rendering
>> ## Input Data strategy & Technics
>>> Auto FEED : Official and Legal published data are usually scheduled
>>> Auto DEDUCT : Surrounded Report hold a huge amount of published data
>>> High Probability around static data accross different sources
>>> Internally supervised static data : Human factorisation
>>> Externally supervised static data : Reverse Human factorisation
>>> Surrounding real time data : Reverse auto feed
>>> Real time data reoffseted : Auto feed
>>> Static data completion Feed Logger
>>> Real time data feed
>>> Auto correctness
>>> Auto qualification
>> ## Horizontal Key technics
>>> Generate a general purpose HASH
>>> generate on the fly LZH key over a incremental but distriubed dictionnary
>>> reGenerate all key for ZIPHASH
>> ## Vertical Key Technics
>>> add versioning windows and cross reference BEFORE and AFTER ( Linked List )
>>> store vertical vector by timestamp
 
> ## Organisation  of a anonymous Market 
>> Authorized Actor by Vernam cryptography and synchronisation technics
>> Authorized by Speed capacity
>> Authorized by Storage capacity
>> Market Asset Descriptor
>> Order Book Management and Limit
>> Compliance strategy
>> KYC / TRACFIN / NETTING / WALL 
>> FEES computation
>> Settlement
>> Loan Asset Pool
