Actor A , want to exchange his delivery of products against a pool of needs and promise of benefit future

In traditionnal Banking system, we would use Cash as a pivot 
In modern Banking , we would use an electronic secure treasure bond for each parties with a credit default score
In shariah Banking, we would secure using a performance metric and american option model to desactivate the operations
In bitcoin Banking, we would use a trusted third party cash holder for both parties to settle all the above 
In shadow Banking, we automate performance of assets and upon agreement deliver differences or products

For a regulator point of view, notional of operation is low, however leveraging is high and should be reported with a leverage of True Notional of Asset Value / Max( Notional of Cash, Min Asset Value )

So as countrary as you people think, shadow banking is highly complex and require a dual acknowledgement of asset model value and a shared model

As such , a shadow bank is responsible not for the price but for correct valuation and model of asset run during the operation
